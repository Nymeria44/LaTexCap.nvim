## Disclaimer
This is very much a personal project and not a plugin that is not supported in any real way 
(Although I plan on using it personally and keeping it operational).

# Installation 

### Dependencies
To use this plugin, you need to install the LaTex-ORC, 
the GitHub of which can be found [here](https://github.com/lukas-blecher/LaTeX-OCR)

If you have [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) already installed, 
LaTex-ORC can also be done by running the following command:
```
pip install pix2tex
```
